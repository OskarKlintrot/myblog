This will be my website where I host my blog and maybe also some photos later on. It won't be updated frequently, if at all. The reason I have created this blog is because we only have an [finite number of keystrokes left before I die](http://keysleft.com/). So if I, against all odds, do come up with something to share I will post it here and give that link to whom may want it. If that's you, great! If not, glad you visited my little corner of the web anyway. I'm flattered. So who ever you are, welcome to my webpage full of ~~wisdome~~ ~~typos~~ keystrokes!

Yours sincerely,
Oskar Klintrot
